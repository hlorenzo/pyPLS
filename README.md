# pyPLS

PyPLS is a package built around PLS and especially the implementation of noPLS (no overfitting Partial Least Squares)

It also provides a few tools to facilitate the use of and test PLS and noPLS:

- Normalisation
- Preprocessing
- Simulation
- PCA

# Prerequisites
pPLS requires the following packages to be installed on a python > 3.6 distribution: numpy pandas scipy

`pip install numpy pandas scipy`

To plot the output of the different function `matplotlib` could be also installed. It is not a requirement but it is always useful to have it installed aside.

`pip install matplotlib`

# Installation

This also mean that after installation, a simple pull from the GitHub repository could provide you. In the directory So installing from this notebook run the following cell:
